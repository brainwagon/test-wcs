# WCS Coordinate System and Tetra3 Exploration

This repository contains code and images to help understand the World Coordinate System (WCS) and its use with the `tetra3` library.

The `test.py` script demonstrates how to work with WCS coordinates, likely using the included JPG images (`overlay.jpg` and `stars-0000.jpg`) as input.
